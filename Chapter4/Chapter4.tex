A band is a region in cS1-\cstwob (or some variation thereof) space where events of a certain recoil type occur.  To
differentiate the nuclear from electronic recoil bands, calibrations for each are performed and fit.  These are critical as
they provide information on the reference region and discrimination power between potential WIMP signals and background.  \ce{^{220}Rn}
calibrations are used for the ER band and are performed regularly.  For NR, \ce{^{241}AmBe} and a deuterium-deuterium
neutron generator (NG) are used, both of which are positioned in the water tank outside the cryostat.  \ambe calibrations are done in
both science runs and a NG calibration is performed in SR1 only.

For this analysis all five sets of calibration data from both science runs were fit simultaneously.  This was
significant because it forced values that are common to some or all of the calibrations (e.g. $W$, $p_{\mathrm{dpe}}$ are shared
between all five, while $g_1$, $g_{2\mathrm{b}}$ are shared within science runs) to be described by a single
value.\footnote{For First Results the \radoncal and \ambe were independently fit.}

This chapter presents the electronic and nuclear recoil band fitting used in the run-combined analysis (\chapref{chap:xenon1t}).  It
begins with a summary of the importance of the calibrations (\secref{sec:er_nr_calibrations_purpose}) followed by a description of how
the parameters in the fit are determined (\secref{sec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ}).  Lastly, the results of the fit are
presented (\secref{sec:er_nr_calibrations_results}).



\section{Purpose of Calibrations}
\label{sec:er_nr_calibrations_purpose}
For any event we would like to be able to calculate the probabilities of its possible origins.  Fitting the electronic and nuclear
recoil bands creates probability density functions (PDFs) for the ER background and WIMP signals, respectively.  Since they overlap
(the ER $-2\sigma$ is at roughly the NR median) it is important to carefully characterize their PDFs so events can be classified
as accurately as possible.  This approach improves sensitivity over
data-driven approaches.  The method in this section requires a complete understanding of the TPC
backgrounds, which
in addition to electronic recoils includes wall leakage (\secref{subsec:backgrounds_detector_materials}) and accidental
coincidence (\secref{subsec:backgrounds_ac}).  It also demands that
the physical processes that occur - from the decay of the source to the data acquisition - are correctly modeled and can be
simulated on a reasonable time scale.

Following the fit, a signal PDF is generated using the nuclear recoil result.  For this analysis the signal is a spin-independent WIMP but
this approach will work for other signal models.  The shape of the signal PDF depends on the WIMP mass, as shown in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_purpose_wimp_contours}.  The ER band is the bright yellow region and the horizontal band around
$\mathrm{cS2_b} = 150\ \mathrm{PE}$ is
accidental coincidence.  The overlap between signal and background emphasizes the importance of the electronic and nuclear recoil band
fit.  An incorrect fit might shift the positions of the bands, changing our understanding of the origins of the events.  The data is
compared to the sum of the background and WIMP PDFs for each WIMP mass and cross section, and a discovery can be claimed if the data
prefers a signal plus background over exclusively background model.  If an excess is not observed a limit is set where
cross sections below some value match the data.

$\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ WIMPs.  The bright yellow region is the
electronic recoil band, which was fit using a similar method to this section.  Accidental coincidence is visible as the horizontal strip
around $\mathrm{cS2_b} = 150\ \mathrm{PE}$.  The expected signal region changes with WIMP mass.}

\section{Liquid Xenon TPC Modeling}
\label{sec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ}
This approach compares the distributions of Monte Carlo events and data to infer physics model parameters.  Because of the nearly flat
distribution of events in the energy
region of interest and homogeneous position distribution, Monte Carlo variables $E_{\mathrm{true}}$, $x_{\mathrm{true}}$,
$y_{\mathrm{true}}$, and $z_{\mathrm{true}}$ for \ce{^{220}Rn} are each randomly drawn from uniform distributions for each
event.  \ce{^{241}AmBe} and
neutron generator Monte Carlo are simulated using GEANT4 \citeref{Agostinelli2003}, and include the number of
scatters for each neutron.  The small volume of energy deposition for $\beta^-$ ($\mathcal{O}({\sim}1)\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) in
our energy region of interest means it is not necessary to track the number of scatters for
\ce{^{220}Rn}.\footnote{$1 \mdash 10\ \mathrm{keV}$ $\beta^-$ have stopping powers of ${\sim}28.4 \mdash 85.2\ \mathrm{keV\ \mu m^{-1}}$
(\secref{subsec:stopping_power}).}  These
values represent the ``truth'' information - that is, these are the true interaction values, and are inputs to the full
simulation.  Reconstructed $x \mdash y$ values will be referred to as $x_{\mathrm{rec}}$
and $y_{\mathrm{rec}}$.  Effects such as electric field non-uniformity and drift time measurement resolution cause
$||z_{\mathrm{rec}} - z_{\mathrm{true}}|| > 0$.  However, these effects are small enough that they can be ignored, so moving forward
true and reconstructed depths will be assumed equivalent and denoted by $z$.  Likewise,
$E_{\mathrm{rec}} \neq E_{\mathrm{true}}$ since S1 and S2 are used for energy reconstruction
(\secref{subsubsec:tpcs_signals_energy}).  Because the energy reconstruction method is usually specified, $E \equiv E_{\mathrm{true}}$ for
the remainder of this chapter.

\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_flow_chart} shows the flow chart for the band fit.  Each Monte Carlo event is
simulated through a series of physical models that mimic our best understanding of the expected processes in the detector as closely as
possible.  The parameters in the fit come from
a variety of sources including microphysics reported from literature and detector characterization measurements
(\secref{sec:det_char}).  The simulation takes the true energy from a Monte Carlo event and outputs observables cS1 and
$\mathrm{cS2_b}$.  These in turn are binned in cS1-$\mathrm{log_{10}(cS2_b / cS1)}$ space, and the likelihood for equivalent bins
between data and MC is calculated (\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match}).  Our energy region of interest is
defined as $0 \leq \mathrm{cS1} \leq 100$ and $0.5 \leq \mathrm{log_{10}(cS2_b / cS1)} \leq 3.5$.  As the parameters vary, the likelihood
will increase or decrease and the minimizer will find the best-fit values.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{flow_chart}
\caption{Steps for fitting electronic and nuclear recoil bands.  The signal (NR) model, background (ER) model, and additional inputs (e.g.
detector model, S2 threshold, AC) (red) make up the parameters (yellow) in the fit.  Each parameter is constrained by its
prior distribution (yellow).  Parameters convert truth MC (grey) to cS1 and \cstwob in the fast MC (yellow), which is then binned.  Data
(pink) from calibrations is binned
and the likelihood (aqua) is computed using the histograms and prior distributions.  A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (aqua)
calculates the values of the parameters for the next iteration.  The posterior is shown in green.  Blue arrows represent steps that are
only done once.}
\label{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_flow_chart}
\end{figure}

The process of converting the truth MC to cS1 and \cstwob is referred to as a ``fast MC'' (random numbers are drawn from probability
distributions to generate sets of parameters).  ``Truth MC'' refers to the simulated events before the fast MC ($E_{\mathrm{true}}$,
$x_{\mathrm{true}}$, $y_{\mathrm{true}}$, $z_{\mathrm{true}}$, and number
of scatters).  ``MC'' will denote the sum of all the fast MC results, usually in the form of a PDF or histogram, for
comparison with data.  Finally, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to sample the likelihood defined by the data and MC and the
best-fit values
are derived from the resulting posterior.  \secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er} (ER) and
\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr} (NR) discusses the physical steps that occur beginning with energy
deposition and ending with cS1 and $\mathrm{cS2_b}$, which are modeled in the fast MC.

The number of fast MC events simulated for each likelihood iteration is $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$.  A fast MC event randomly selects one of the
truth input events.  Such large statistics are necessary to reliably model the bands;
however, nominal running time is far higher than any sensible time-scale.  This was solved by using graphical processing units (GPUs),
which can run the events in parallel, providing a boost in speed by a factor of $10^{2 \mdash 3}$ and reducing the required time to a
reasonable level.

The calibrations were fit in the First Results FV ($-92.9 < z < -9\ \mathrm{cm}$, $r_{\mathrm{rec}} < 36.94\ \mathrm{cm}$
\figref{fig:calibrations_position_reconstruction}) despite the 1.3 t fiducial mass used for the dark matter analysis.  This was done to
minimize surface events and other contamination from materials at the top and bottom of the TPC.



\subsection{Electronic Recoils}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er}
The electronic recoil calibration is performed using \ce{^{220}Rn} (decay chain shown in the left panel of
\figref{fig:backgrounds_decay_chains}).  It is used because of the \ce{^{212}Pb} \betadecay (Q-value of 569.9 keV), can
be performed as an internal calibration.\footnote{In the future we hope to use tritiated methane $\mathrm{C H_3 T}$, which undergoes
\betadecay
with a maximum energy of 18.6 keV.  This would provide significantly more statistics in our region of interest in a shorter amount
of time.  However, as mentioned in \secref{subsubsec:xenon1t_calibrations_internal} $\mathrm{C H_3 T}$ has a half-life of 12.3 y and there
is concern it may attach to the cryostat.}  A total of six calibrations were
performed during SR0 and SR1.

When energy is deposited in LXe a number of quanta $n_q$ will be produced.  For electronic recoils this follows the normal distribution

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_q \sim \mathrm{Norm} \bigg( \mu = \frac{E}{W},\ \sigma^2 = \frac{E F}{W} \bigg)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er_quanta}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $F$ is the Fano Factor \citeref{Fano1947} discussed in \secref{sec:er}.  Its derivation and subsequent measurements
demonstrates that fluctuations in $n_q$ are smaller than a Poisson distribution, and is estimated to be $F = 0.059$
\citeref{Doke1976}.  For the
fast MC, $F$ is fixed.  Although a later measurement found different best-fit values, their result was
compatible with \citeref{Doke1976} when including uncertainty \citeref{Seguinot1995}.  The average energy to produce a single
quanta, $W$, is constrained by a Gaussian with $\mu = 13.7,\ \sigma = 0.2\ \mathrm{eV}$ following the measurement of \citeref{Dahl2009}.

For electronic recoils, quenching is negligible so is not considered.  The quanta will be divided into excitons and electron-ion pairs
$n_q = n_{\mathrm{ex}} + n_{\mathrm{ion}}$ according to a binomial distribution

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{ion}} \sim \mathrm{Binom} \Bigg(n = n_{\mathrm{q}},\ p = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{n_{\mathrm{ex}}}{n_{\mathrm{ion}}}} \Bigg)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er_nions}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n_{\mathrm{ex}} / n_{\mathrm{ion}}$ is constrained to $0.06 \mdash 0.2$ and expected to be energy independent
\citeref{NEST2011}.  Some \electron will recombine with \ce{Xe^+} to form
excitons and emit photons as they decay to the ground state.  The recombination fraction $r$ depends on the field in the LXe and the
interaction energy, and has intrinsic fluctuations $\Delta r$ \citeref{LUX2016, Aprile2018a}.  A truncated Gaussian is assumed

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
r \sim \mathrm{Norm} \Big( \mu = \langle r \rangle,\ \sigma^2 = (\Delta r)^2 \Big)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $0 \leq r, \Delta r \leq 1$ and is parameterized using a modified Thomas-Imel box model \citeref{Thomas1987}

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
\langle r \rangle = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(E - E_0) / E_1}}
\bigg[ 1 - \frac{\mathrm{ln}(1 + n_{\mathrm{ion}} \varsigma / 4)}{n_{\mathrm{ion}} \varsigma / 4} \bigg]
,\ \ \varsigma = \gamma_{\mathrm{er}} e^{-E / \omega_{\mathrm{er}}} E_d^{-\delta_{\mathrm{er}}}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_ti}
\end{equation}

\noindent for the fit.  Here $\varsigma$ has been adapted from \eqnref{eq:ti_recomb} to include a power law field-dependence to allow
simultaneous fitting of SR0 and SR1, and an exponential energy term to extend compatibility to high energy
(${\sim} 20\ \mathrm{keV_{ee}}$).  An energy-dependent Fermi-Dirac suppresses recombination at
${\lesssim}\, 2\ \mathrm{keV_{ee}}$ to allow more freedom to fit the data and literature.  The parameters do not have well-defined priors
and are constrained to $0 \leq \gamma_{\mathrm{er}} \leq 0.5$, $0 \leq E_0, E_1 < \infty$, and
$-\infty < \omega_{\mathrm{er}}, \delta_{\mathrm{er}} < \infty$.

Recombination fluctuations are modeled as

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\Delta r = A(1 - e^{-E/B})
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er_rec_fluctuations}
\end{equation}

\noindent where parameters $A,B > 0$ are allowed to vary freely.  The number of electron-ion pairs that recombine is

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{rec}} \sim \mathrm{Binom} \big(n = n_{\mathrm{ion}},\ p = r \big)
\end{equation}

\noindent yielding final numbers of photons and electrons

\vspace{-30pt}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
n_{\mathrm{ph}} &= n_{\mathrm{ex}} + r\, n_{\mathrm{ion}} \\
n_{\mathrm{e}} &= (1 - r) n_{\mathrm{ion}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}



\subsection{Nuclear Recoils}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr}
Two nuclear recoil sources were used for calibrations: americium beryllium (\ce{^{241}AmBe}) and a neutron generator
(NG).  \ce{^{241}Am} decays to \ce{^{237}Np} by $\alpha$-emission and the large \ce{^{9}Be} $\alpha$ cross-section prompts a second decay

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{^{9}Be} + \mathrm{^{4}He} \rightarrow \mathrm{^{12}C + n} + \gamma
\end{equation}

\noindent emitting a $< 11\ \mathrm{MeV}$ neutron.  The neutron generator (NSD Gradel Fusion NSD-35-DD-C-W-S) uses
deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{^{2}D} + \mathrm{^{2}D} \rightarrow \mathrm{^{3}He} + \mathrm{n}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the \ce{^{3}He} and n are emitted at 0.82 and 2.45 MeV, respectively.  The energy spectrum can be seen in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ng_energy}.  It shows two peaks - one at 2.2 MeV and the other at 2.7 MeV.  These
are the energies seen in the lab frame (2.45 MeV is in the rest frame of the deuteron) and correspond to neutrons emitted at $180^{\circ}$
and $0^{\circ}$, respectively.  The NG can operate at rates as low as $10\ \mathrm{n\ s^{-1}}$
and as high as $10^7\ \mathrm{n\ s^{-1}}$, which allows flexibility for our objectives.  A higher-energy neutron
population is produced by tritium via

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{ng_energy_spectrum}
\caption{Simulated neutron energy spectra in fusion region of the NG (red dashed line) and at the pulse shape discriminator during
calibration before installation at LNGS (blue shaded region).  Deconvolution of data from calibration (black solid line) is also
shown.  Spectra are normalized by the 2.2-2.7 MeV range.  Image credit: \citeref{Lang2018}.}
\label{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ng_energy}
\end{figure}

\vspace{-30pt}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathrm{^{2}D} + \mathrm{^{2}D} &\rightarrow \mathrm{^{3}T} + \mathrm{p} \\
\mathrm{^{3}T} + \mathrm{^{2}D} &\rightarrow \mathrm{^{4}He} + \mathrm{n}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent where the neutron is expelled at 14.1 MeV.  The contribution of deuterium-tritium fusion was measured to be $3.5 \pm 0.2\%$
before installation at LNGS \citeref{Lang2018}.  Because the tritium is created in deuterium-deuterium fusion and has
$t_{1/2} = 12.3\ \mathrm{y}$, its fraction will increase with continued use.  For details on the characterization of the NG
please refer to \citeref{Lang2018}.

The positions for \ambe and NG events are shown in \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ambe_positions} and
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ng_positions}.  Their ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ mean free path causes clustering
closest to the calibration source.  Because we expect our
detector does not vary over $r$ and $\phi$ inside the 1 t FV the results of the asymmetric position distribution are applied to the entire
active volume.  Events in the region furthest from the source are mostly background.  Fewer background events are present in the NG data
because of the shorter calibration time.  SR0 \ambe is not shown but its distribution of NR events is similar to
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ambe_positions} because the location of the source was the same.  Many more ER events,
however, were present since it preceded the online distillation (\secref{subsec:xenon1t_kr_dist}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ambe_positions}
\caption{Positions of events from SR1 \ambe calibration.  Events are clustered in the region of the detector closest to the \ambe
source.  The black line marks the 1 t fiducial volume.  Aside from the higher ER background, the SR0 distribution looks similar since the
source was placed in the same location inside the water tank.}
\label{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ambe_positions}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ng_positions}
\caption{Positions of events from SR1 neutron generator calibration.  Events are densely distributed in the region of the TPC closest to
the NG source.  The black line shows the 1 t fiducial volume.}
\label{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_ng_positions}
\end{figure}

The microphysical processes that follow a nuclear recoil differ from ER (\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er}).  As
discussed in \secref{sec:nr} a sizable portion of the energy is lost to atomic motion.  To model this we use the Lindhard theory
in \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_lindhard}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\epsilon &= 11.5 \bigg( \frac{E}{\mathrm{keV}} \bigg) Z^{-7/3} \\
g( \epsilon ) &= 3 \epsilon ^{0.15} + 0.7 \epsilon ^{0.6} + \epsilon \\
L( \epsilon ) &= \frac{k g( \epsilon ) }{1 + k g( \epsilon )}
\end{align}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_lindhard}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-20pt}

\noindent where $k$ is the proportionality constant between the electronic stopping power and recoiling nucleus velocity.  The Lindhard
factor $L(\epsilon )$ is the fraction of energy converted to excitons or electron-ion pairs, or total quanta

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{q}} \sim \mathrm{P} \bigg( \mu = \frac{E L}{W} \bigg)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_quanta}
\end{equation}

\noindent that follows a Poisson distribution as an approximation.  In reality the track structure of nuclear recoils makes the true
distribution more complicated.  The number of ions is found in the same way as electronic recoils

\vspace{-5pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{ion}} \sim \mathrm{Binom} \Bigg(n = n_{\mathrm{q}},\ p = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{n_{\mathrm{ex}}}{n_{\mathrm{ion}}}} \Bigg)
\end{equation}

\noindent and $n_{\mathrm{ex}} = n_{\mathrm{q}} - n_{\mathrm{ion}}$.  Recombination is given by

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{rec}} \sim \mathrm{Binom} \big(n = n_{\mathrm{ion}},\ p = r \big)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $r$ described by the Thomas-Imel model

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
r = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{ln} (1 + n_{\mathrm{ion}} \varsigma)}{n_{\mathrm{ion}} \varsigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\varsigma$ field-dependent.  Unlike ER, no recombination fluctuations have been observed for nuclear recoils so
$\Delta r$ is not included.  Biexcitonic quenching and Penning processes, both of which decrease
$\mathrm{n_{ph}}$, must also be considered.  Biexcitonic quenching arises when two
\ce{Xe^{*}} interact to free an $e^-$, which quickly loses its kinetic energy
and recombines with a \ce{Xe^{+}}.  Thus, what would have been two photons instead results in one.  The Penning process describes when
two excimers interact and result in an excited and ground state \citeref{Mei2008}.  Both of these depend on the exciton density, which
is proportional to the ionization density and therefore stopping power $dE / dx$ (\secref{subsec:stopping_power}).  They result in quenching
and can be
described by Birks' saturation law, \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_birks} \citeref{Birks1951, Birks1964}:

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
f_b = \frac{1}{1 + k_{B}B \frac{dE}{dx}} = \frac{1}{1 + \eta \epsilon^{\lambda}}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_birks}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $k_B$ is Birks' constant (calculated in \citeref{Mei2008} to be $2.015 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{g\ MeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}}$),
$B$ is the coefficient for the stopping power, and $\eta$ is defined to be their product.  The total quenching from biexcitonic
quenching and the Penning process is

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{quench}} = \mathrm{Binom} \big( n = n_{\mathrm{ex}},\ p = f_b \big)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n_{\mathrm{quench}}$ is the number of excitons that do not emit a photon.  Thus the number of excitons moving forward
is $n_{\mathrm{ex}} \leftarrow n_{\mathrm{ex}} - n_{\mathrm{quench}}$.

The parameters in the nuclear recoil model were constrained by previous measurements of light and charge
yield.  This decision was made to prevent detector effects from compensating for changes
in the liquid xenon response model.  We used the results from \citeref{NEST2015}, which used nuclear recoil light and charge yield
measurements between $1 \mdash 300\ \mathrm{keV}$ and electric fields of $0 \mdash 4060\ \mathrm{V\ cm^{-1}}$ to fit the model
detailed in this section.  Although none of the measurements were made for light and charge yields simultaneously, \citeref{NEST2015}
performed a single fit of all data.

The model is parameterized by setting

\vspace{-5pt}

\begin{equation}
\frac{n_{\mathrm{ex}}}{n_{\mathrm{ion}}} = \alpha E_{d}^{-\zeta} ( 1 - e^{-\beta \epsilon})
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_nex_nion}
\end{equation}

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
\varsigma = \gamma E_{d}^{- \delta}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_recomb_sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, $E_d$ is the drift field.  From \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_nex_nion},
$n_{\mathrm{ex}} / n_{\mathrm{ion}}$ has a power dependence on $E_d$,
which is suspected to be caused by geminate recombination: when electrons and parent ions recombine much more quickly than Thomas-Imel
recombination.  In addition, $n_{\mathrm{ex}} / n_{\mathrm{ion}}$ depends exponentially on energy such that at higher energy a larger
fraction of excitons is favored.

We see in \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_recomb_sigma} that $\varsigma$ is proportional to a power of $E_d$.  The
Thomas-Imel theory predicts

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
\varsigma = \frac{\alpha^{\prime}}{4 a^2 u_- E_d}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha ^{\prime}$ is a recombination coefficient, $a$ is the dimension of the box, and $u_-$ is the electron
mobility.  While here $\delta$ is strictly 1, Dahl's model predicts $\delta \sim 0.1$ \citeref{Dahl2009}.

The marginalized posteriors from \citeref{NEST2015} of $k$ (\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_lindhard}), $\eta$ and

\tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_nest}.  They are used as gaussian priors for this analysis.

\subsection{Detector Effects}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys}
After the microphysics emission processes, the properties of our detector become relevant as they convert
$n_{\mathrm{ph}} \rightarrow \mathrm{S1}$ and $n_{\mathrm{e}} \rightarrow \mathrm{S2}$.  This is in part why the
characterizations detailed in \secref{sec:det_char} are essential.  Although the \ce{^{220}Rn}, \ce{^{241}AmBe}, and NG calibrations
were performed at different times they were fit simultaneously.  Changes in detector conditions
are accounted for by having different central values of the relevant detector parameters.  Parameters that are expected to be correlated
between calibrations are characterized with a single prior (e.g. though SR0 and SR1 have different S1 cut efficiencies, the relative change
from central values is shared).

The first process following the microphysics model to consider is position reconstruction
(\secref{subsec:det_char_position_reconstruction}).  The reason is that
any position-dependent correction is applied to the position we measure since we cannot know the truth.  The $x \mdash y$ position
reconstruction resolution $((x_{\mathrm{rec}} - x_{\mathrm{true}})^2 + (y_{\mathrm{rec}} - y_{\mathrm{true}})^2)^{1/2}$ is shown in
\figref{fig:calibrations_position_reconstruction_res}.  The poor resolution at
$n_e \lesssim 100\ e^-$ ($\mathrm{S2_b} \lesssim 1000\ \mathrm{PE}$) indicates that in our lowest dark matter energy region events inside
(outside) the FV will have a reasonable chance of being reconstructed outside (inside) - especially near the boundary.  After simulating
the position reconstruction $x_{\mathrm{truth}} \rightarrow x_{\mathrm{rec}}$ and
$y_{\mathrm{truth}} \rightarrow y_{\mathrm{rec}}$, the truth values are no longer considered in the analysis of the fast MC.

The number of photons from the interaction site that produce one or more photoelectrons is dependent on two effects.  The first is
the position-dependent light collection efficiency (LCE) $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{lce}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}}, z)$, which
accounts for detector effects such as ${<}\, 100\%$ PTFE reflectivity and
absorption of light by impurities that reduce the amount of light that reaches the PMTs
(\secref{subsec:det_char_lce}).  The second is the probability of double photoelectron emission (DPE) $p_{\mathrm{dpe}}$, which was found
to be much higher than originally thought, ranging from 0.18-0.24 for the various PMTs tested by \citeref{Faham2015} and $0.225 \pm 0.01$
for the Hamamatsu R11410 model (\secref{subsec:xenon1t_pmts}).  The parameter of interest therefore is not the quantum efficiency
$\eta_{\mathrm{\mu}}$, but rather the
fraction of incident photons that generate at least one PE $\eta_{\mathrm{p}}$.  As shown in \eqnref{eq:xenon1t_pmts_dpe}
$\eta_{\mathrm{\mu}} / \eta_{\mathrm{p}} = 1 + p_{\mathrm{dpe}}$.  Accounting for both of these effects the number of photons that
generate $\geq 1\ \mathrm{PE}$ is shown in \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_npe}.

\vspace{-20pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{p}} = \mathrm{Binom} \bigg( n = n_{\mathrm{ph}},\ p =
\frac{g_1 \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{lce}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}}, z)}{1 + p_{\mathrm{dpe}}} \bigg)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_npe}
\end{equation}

To calculate the total number of photons that produce DPE

\vspace{-25pt}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
n_{\mathrm{dpe}} &= \mathrm{Binom} (n = n_{\mathrm{p}},\ p = p_{\mathrm{dpe}} ) \\
n_{\mathrm{pe,S1}} &= n_{\mathrm{p}} + n_{\mathrm{dpe}}
\end{align}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_num_pe}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-25pt}

\noindent where $n_{\mathrm{pe,S1}}$ is the total number of photoelectrons.

As the signals from the PMTs are fed into and recorded by the DAQ (\secref{subsec:xenon1t_daq}) and later processed, three effects are
introduced:
S1 peak finding (processor) efficiency, bias, and smearing - all of which are the most influential at low photon counts.  The S1 peak
finding efficiency is the probability that the S1 is recognized by the reconstruction and
classification algorithm amongst PMT dark count, DAQ, and other electronic noise, as well as low-energy S2s that are known to occasionally
follow large S2s (known as S2 ``tails'').  Additionally, if less than three PMTs observe the S1 it is discarded.  The processor efficiency
cannot be modeled using data since it is
not possible to know when a signal was not found.  Instead simulated waveforms are processed with the reconstruction and
classification algorithm.  The
waveforms are generated with DAQ conditions that have been measured in order to replicate real waveforms as well as possible.  Separate
efficiencies are used for the SR0 \ambe calibration (performed before installation of filter boxes), SR0, and SR1.  It is expected to be
reasonably accurate and is shown as the red shaded regions in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs}.  For the fit the relative deviation from the median is expected to be a
systematic effect so is correlated between the three inputs.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bbf_inputs_sr0_sr1}
\caption{S1- and $\mathrm{S2_b}$-dependent detector parameter 68\% credible intervals for SR0 (left) and SR1 (right).  Processor
efficiency (red) is plotted with respect to the
S1 axis but in units of hits.  Filter boxes were installed on the DAQ between the SR0 \ambe calibration and
dark matter data taking so separate processor efficiencies and S1 and S2 biases and smearings are used (shown as transparent in same
color).  The filter boxes led to improvement, particularly for the processor efficiency and S1 bias and smearing.  The uncertainty on the
processor efficiency also decreased.}
\label{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs}
\end{figure}

Bias and smearing (\secref{subsec:det_char_bias_smearing}) characterize the difference between true and reconstructed areas of the
scintillation.  They originate from noise, S2 tails, and the clustering and separation ability of the reconstruction and classification
algorithm.  As with the efficiency, it is
impossible to measure directly from data since the true area is not known beforehand.  By using
waveform simulations however, input ``truth'' values are compared with the reconstructed values.  Slices in
$(\mathrm{S1_{rec}} - \mathrm{S1_{truth}}) / \mathrm{S1_{truth}}$, where
$\mathrm{S1_{rec}}$ and $\mathrm{S1_{truth}}$ are the reconstructed and truth S1s, are fit with gaussians.  The mean is known as
the fractional bias $\mu_{b, \mathrm{S1}}$ and standard deviation as fractional smearing $\sigma_{b, \mathrm{S1}}$ for each bin.  They
are shown as the blue and green shaded regions in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs}.  As with the processor efficiency, the bias and smearing changed after
the filter boxes were installed, and the three inputs share an uncertainty that accounts for systematic effects (bias and smearing have
independent parameters).  For the fit, they are constrained to the shaded regions and applied
in the fast MC via \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s1_bias_smear}.

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{S1} = n_{\mathrm{pe,S1}} \Big[ 1 + \mathrm{Norm} \big( \mu = \mu_{b, \mathrm{S1}},\ \sigma^2 = \sigma_{b, \mathrm{S1}}^2 \big)
\Big]
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s1_bias_smear}
\end{equation}

Because multiple scatters happen so close in time the S1s are typically not resolvable.  Thus in the fast MC all S1s are summed, though
this only affects \ambe and NG data (\betadecay of \ce{^{212}Pb} should not multiple-scatter).  The LCE map is applied

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{cS1} = \frac{\mathrm{S1}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{lce}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}}, z)}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_cs1}
\end{equation}

\noindent to obtain the corrected S1.  In the case of multiple scatters the S1 will be corrected by a single
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{lce}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}}, z)$ with $x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}}, z$ calculated from the S2
(\secref{subsec:det_char_position_reconstruction}), though in reality the various interactions have
likely occurred in different regions of the detector.  The cS1 then is not fully representative of the total light yield.  However,
a single scatter cut is applied that requires the energy of additional depositions to be below a threshold
(\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_cuts}).  In addition, to be
consistent we apply an identical correction in the fast MC, so (assuming our GEANT4 MC multiple-scatter model is sufficiently
valid) this does not impact our results.

The \electron move from the interaction site towards the liquid-gas interface.  As they drift, electronegative
impurities will bind to them, reducing the total number that reach the surface and are extracted across the GXe.  The attachment rate
is field-dependent, and for \ce{O_{2}} - expected to be the largest contributor - decreases with larger $E_d$
(\secref{subsec:tpcs_working_principle}).

Inhomogeneities in $E_d$ influence the charge yield in two ways.  First, the impurity attachment rate will change depending on the
position in the TPC.   This causes the number of \electron that reach the surface from events in different regions to be
biased.  The second is the light and charge yield vary with electric field (shown in
\figref{fig:tpcs_signals_drift_field}).  Therefore events at the same energy may have
different yields depending on where in the TPC they occur.  Neither of these effects are considered
in the fast MC, introducing a small systematic error.  However, beacause $E_d$ is extremely uniform inside the FV, as shown in
\figref{fig:xenon1t_tpc_efield}, the error should be small.

The electron lifetime used is randomly selected from the collection of lifetimes measured for each calibration.  Any global
systematic error in measured lifetimes \eqnref{eq:det_char_elifetime} is accounted for with a normal distribution

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\tau_{e, \mathrm{true}} = \tau_{e, \mathrm{rec}} \Big[ 1 + \mathrm{Norm} \big( \mu = 0,\ \sigma^2 = \sigma_{e}^2 \big) \Big]
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_elife_true}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\tau_{e, \mathrm{rec}}$ and $\tau_{e, \mathrm{true}}$ refer to the reconstructed (measured) and true electron
lifetimes, and $\sigma_e$ is the systematic uncertainty on $\tau_{e, \mathrm{rec}}$.  It is set to
$\sigma_{e, \mathrm{SR0}} = 0.04$ and $\sigma_{e, \mathrm{SR1}} = 0.5 \sigma_{e, \mathrm{SR0}}$.  The difference is because we are
more confident in the electron lifetimes for SR1 (\figref{fig:det_char_elifetime_evolution}).  The true and reconstructed electron
survival probabilities are given in \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_prob_elifetime}.

\vspace{-20pt}

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
p_{\mathrm{rec}} (t_d) &= e^{-t_d / \tau_{e, \mathrm{rec}}} \\
p_{\mathrm{true}} (t_d) &= e^{-t_d / \tau_{e, \mathrm{true}}}
\end{align}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_prob_elifetime}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-30pt}

The number of \electron that survive to the surface $n_{\mathrm{surv}}$ is calculated using

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{surv}} = \mathrm{Binom} \Big( n = n_{\mathrm{e}},\ p = p_{\mathrm{surv}} \Big) ,\ \ \
p_{\mathrm{surv}} = p_{\mathrm{true}} \times (1 - p_{\mathrm{wall}})
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_drift_electrons}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p_{\mathrm{wall}}$
refers to the probability an \electron attaches to the wall; however, because this is only relevant in the $1 \mdash 2\ \mathrm{cm}$
next to the PTFE we can ignore its effects and set $p_{\mathrm{wall}} = 0$.  The number of electrons extracted from the liquid
$n_{\mathrm{extr}}$ depends only on $n_{\mathrm{surv}}$ and the probability of extraction $\eta_{EE}$

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{extr}} = \mathrm{Binom} \Big( n = n_{\mathrm{surv}},\ p = \eta_{EE} \Big)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\eta_{EE} = 0.936$ and $0.933$ for SR0 and SR1, respectively, and is fixed in the fast MC (the change in notation from
\secref{subsec:det_char_photon_charge_efficiencies} is to avoid confusion with $\eta$ in the nuclear recoil model,
\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_birks}).  The single electron gain is given by

\vspace{-5pt}

\begin{equation}
G (x, y) = \frac{g_{2\mathrm{b}} \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{S2_b}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}})}{\eta_{EE}} =
G_e \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{S2_b}}(x_{\mathrm{rec}}, y_{\mathrm{rec}})
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_gg}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $G_e$ is the nominal position-averaged gas gain (\secref{subsec:det_char_single_electron_gain}) and
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{S2_b}}(x, y)$ is the \stwob $x \mdash y$ correction map
(\secref{subsec:det_char_s2_position_correction}).  Approximating the amplification as a gaussian the number of photoelectrons is

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
n_{\mathrm{pe,S2_b}} =  \mathrm{Norm} \Big( \mu = n_{\mathrm{extr}} G,\
\sigma^2 = n_{\mathrm{extr}} \sigma_{G}^2 G^2 \Big)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s2_num_pe}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $G = G(x, y)$ to simplify notation and $\sigma_G$ is the gas gain resolution and is 0.24 and 0.25 for SR0 and
SR1.  Similar to the S1, there will be bias and smearing.  Using the same assumptions we find

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{S2_b} = n_{\mathrm{pe,S2_b}} \Big[ 1 + \mathrm{Norm}(\mu = \mu_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}},\ \sigma^2 = \sigma_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}^2) \Big]
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s2_bias_smear}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mu_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$ and $\sigma_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$ are the \stwob fractional bias and smearing,
respectively.  They are shown as the pink and yellow bands in \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs}, and
deviations in the fit are parameterized by a single variable.  In
practice \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_gg,eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s2_num_pe,eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s2_bias_smear} are applied
for the total S2 - however, in the fast MC the treatment is slightly different.  After
\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_s2_num_pe} we calculate
$\mathrm{S2} = \mathrm{S2_b} / (1 - f_{\mathrm{aft}})$ where $f_{\mathrm{aft}} = 0.627$ (fixed) is the mean fraction of light from an
S2 that is observed by the top PMT array.  Bias and smearing are then applied.  While in reality the total bias and smearing
can differ from that of the bottom array, to save memory we use $\mu_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$ and $\sigma_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$.  Any
difference is too small to affect the results so can be disregarded.  $\mu_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$ and $\sigma_{b, \mathrm{S2_b}}$ are shown
in the right panel of \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs} and as with the S1, are constrained to the
shaded regions for the fit.

Lastly the electron lifetime and S2 position corrections are applied to calculate the corrected S2.

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{cS2_b} = \frac{\mathrm{S2_b}}{\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{S2_b}} p_{\mathrm{rec}}}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Selection Criteria}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_cuts}
Each event in the data must pass a series of selection criteria.  Because the criteria were developed to select good events - that is,
events that are
clearly the result of an interaction in the LXe - most are not necessary for the fast-MC since ``bad'' events are not simulated.  An
example is the requirement on the fraction of the S1 observed by the top PMT array must fall within a range determined by analysis, in
part to reject events in the GXe.  This is irrelevant to the fast-MC since only events in the LXe are included as input.

There are a couple of citeria that, assuming the data quality is good, select which events to keep.  The first is a requirement that
$\mathrm{S2} > 200\ \mathrm{PE}$, referred to as the S2 threshold.  The second criteria is introduced to remove events that have more than
one scatter by rejecting those where the second-largest \stwob falls above some $\mathrm{S2_b}$-dependent threshold.  However, it can be
difficult to determine if multiple scatters occurred - particularly at low energy, and for nuclear
recoils, which have a long mean free path and low light and charge yields.  Thus some multi-scatter events are inevitably included,
with the restriction that the ratio of the first to second scatters is large.  This is not a concern for \ce{^{220}Rn}.

For the remainder of the selection criteria S1 and S2 efficiencies are computed using the data to understand what fraction of good events
are lost as a result of each selection.  The product of all efficiencies is included in the fast MC for consistency and are used to
accept events with a fraction equivalent to the data.  They are shown as the light blue (S1) and
black (S2) bands in \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_inputs}.



\subsection{Backgrounds}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_additional_components}
While the majority of events recorded during a calibration are from the source a subset comes
from background.  These are included in the analysis to avoid fitting events that are not described by the recoil model of the source.

Electronic recoils (\secref{subsec:backgrounds_electronic}) are by far the largest background.  For \ce{^{220}Rn}
they do not present a problem but need to be included in the NR fits.  The ER model, constrained by the \ce{^{220}Rn} data, is also used
in the likelihood for NR calibration data.

The higher event rate causes increased accidental coincidence (\secref{subsec:backgrounds_ac}).  This is more dramatic
for \ambe and NG data where neutrons with small scattering angles may produce a very small S1 or S2.  AC distributions are included
in all five calibrations.  SR0 and SR1 \ce{^{220}Rn} AC constrain one other through
$R_{\mathrm{AC}}^{\mathrm{(SR1)}} = 3.75 R_{\mathrm{AC}}^{\mathrm{(SR0)}} - 0.0625$.  SR0 and SR1 \ambe
have the same AC expectation since the location and activity of the source and duration were the same.  However, they do not share
parameters so are independently fit.  AC is not
simulated in the fast MC, and only the amplitude of the distributions are allowed to vary by gaussian-constrained parameters.

Surface events were not included because they are far from the fiducial volume.



\subsection{Statistical Inference}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match}
The fit is performed with a binned likelihood approach using Bayesian inference.  Fast MC events (typically $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$) and
data are each binned in cS1 vs. $\mathrm{log_{10}(cS2_b / cS1)}$.  The log-likelihood for the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ bin is
computed as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_i &=\frac{\hat{b}_{i}^{b_i} e^{-\hat{b}_{i}}}{b_{i}!} \\
\mathrm{ln}\, \mathcal{L}_i &= b_i\, \mathrm{ln} (\hat{b}_i) - \hat{b}_i - \mathrm{ln} (b_i !)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent where \bhi and $b_i$ is are the expected (MC) and true (data) number of events in the bin, respectively.  The log-likelihood is
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} &= \prod_i \mathcal{L}_i \\
\mathrm{ln}\, \mathcal{L} &= \sum_i \mathrm{ln}\, \mathcal{L}_i = \sum_i b_i\, \mathrm{ln} (\hat{b}_i) - \hat{b}_i - \mathrm{ln} (b_i !)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\vspace{-10pt}

\noindent over all bins.  The parameters
responsible for the fast Monte Carlo ($\hat{b}_i$) were detailed in
\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er,subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr,subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys,subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_cuts}.  As
discussed, each parameter is constrained by our understanding before
the fit using a prior distribution.  For the cases where we expect the error to be either negligible or contained in a dependent parameter
the value is fixed.  Components where we have good knowledge on the uncertainty (e.g. $W$, $g_1$, $g_{2\mathrm{b}}$ etc.) are constrained
with a gaussian.  The S1 and S2 selection efficiencies as well as the S1 peak finding efficiency are modeled by a gaussian
distribution with
mean $\mu = 0$ corresponding to the median value and $\sigma = \pm 1$ to the lower and upper bounds in the credible interval.  Parameters
that have a range of preferred values (e.g. $n_{\mathrm{ex}} / n_{\mathrm{ion}}$, $p_{\mathrm{dpe}}$,
bias and smearing, etc.) are restricted to within these bounds.  Finally, in cases where there is little knowledge, the priors
are left free - though this is only applied to parameters in the electronic recoil recombination model
(\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er}).  Applying more stringent constraints on well-understood parameters reduces
degeneracies and provides more information on those that are less known.

In Bayesian inference a posterior probability is defined based on Bayes' formula
\begin{equation}
p(\vect{\theta}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha}) = \frac{p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\theta})
p(\vect{\theta}|\vect{\alpha})}{p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\alpha})} = \frac{\mathcal{L}(\vect{\theta}|\vectlett{x})
p(\vect{\theta}|\vect{\alpha})}{p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\alpha})}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $p(\vect{\theta}|\vect{\alpha})$ captures the prior understanding of the model and is known as the
\textit{prior probability}.  Constraints on model parameters (parameters of interest and nuisance parameters) $\vect{\theta}$ - generally
from physical restrictions or previous measurements or
knowledge - are stored in hyperparameters $\vect{\alpha}$.  $p(\vect{\theta}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha})$ is the probability of
parameters $\vect{\theta}$ of dimension $n$ given the
data $\vectlett{x}$ and is known as the \textit{posterior probability density}, or \textit{target
density}.  $p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\theta})$ is the probability of the data $\vectlett{x}$ given the parameters
$\vect{\theta}$ and is
commonly referred to as the \textit{likelihood} $\mathcal{L}(\vect{\theta}|\vectlett{x})$.  $p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\alpha})$ is known as
the \textit{marginal likelihood}
and can be computed using \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match_p_data}.  Because it does not depend on
$\vect{\theta}$ it is model-independent so does not contribute to the relative likelihoods between different
$\vect{\theta}$.
\begin{equation}
p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\alpha}) = \int_{\Theta} p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\theta}) p(\vect{\theta}|\vect{\alpha})\, \vectlett{d}^n \vect{\theta}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match_p_data}
\end{equation}

Unfortunately for nearly all models - including those of interest to this analysis - $p(\vectlett{x}|\vect{\alpha})$ is not
calculable.  \secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc} discusses a solution that allows us to estimate the posterior
without needing to solve \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match_p_data}.



\subsection{Markov Chain Monte Carlo}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc}
To estimate the values $\vect{\theta}$ that best fit the data by $\vectlett{x}$ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used.  MCMCs
are a class of algorithms that sample a probability distribution, and are in part desirable because they
give complete knowledge of the full posterior probability
distribution.  An MCMC consists of $k \geq 1$ ``walkers'' with each walker representing an independent set of parameters
$\vect{\theta}_i$.  A large
subpopulation of MCMC algorithms - including the method used in this analysis - use random walk Monte Carlo algorithms, meaning the
walkers randomly sample the parameter space.

A MCMC runs for $T$ iterations or ``steps'' so the total number of samples is $k \times T$.    An array of $k$ walkers of
$\vect{\theta}$ over $T$ iterations forms a ``chain'' that contains the history of the walkers.  Each sample contributes
to the total integral.  In looking for its next move a walker may make a number of trial steps around its perimeter looking for
a point with a high integrand.  A step is dependent solely on the current positions of all $\vect{\theta}$.  Sometimes referred to as
``memorylessness'' this means that with respect to knowing only the walker's current state, knowledge of its entire history would not
improve predictions of its future state, i.e. a walker's past and future states are independent.

The next state in a Markov Chain is computed by

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
f^{(t + 1)} (\theta) = \int f^{(t)} (\theta^{\prime}) p(\theta|\theta^{\prime}) d\theta^{\prime}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_marginal}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f^{(t)}, f^{(t + 1)}$ are the marginal distributions at steps $t$ and $t + 1$ (to simplify notation $\theta$
is used in place of multi-dimensional $\vect{\theta}$).  Therefore, beginning from step $t$, any state
at $m$ steps into the future can be computed.  In the case when initial distribution $f^{(0)}$ is given every state in the Markov Chain
can be calculated.

A Markov Chain is \textit{reversible} if there exists a probability density $\pi (\theta^{\prime})$ such that

\begin{equation}
\pi (\theta^{\prime}) p(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) = \pi (\theta) p(\theta|\theta^{\prime})
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_detailed_balance}
\end{equation}

\noindent for some transition kernel probability density $p(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)$ that defines the probability of
moving to state $\theta^{\prime}$ from $\theta$ in one step.  In other words, 
\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_detailed_balance} states that being in state $\theta$ and transitioning to
$\theta^{\prime}$ must have the same probability as being in state $\theta^{\prime}$ and transitioning to  $\theta$.  When
this is true for all pairs of $\theta, \theta^{\prime}$ (all states can communicate with one another) the Markov Chain
is said to be \textit{irreducible}.  A chain that does not cycle to any state $\theta$ in a predictable way is
\textit{aperiodic}.  \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_detailed_balance}
is known as the \textit{detailed balance condition} and cannot be solved for all Markov Chains.  For those that can, a simple integration
gives

\vspace{-10pt}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\int \pi (\theta^{\prime}) p(\theta|\theta^{\prime}) d\theta^{\prime} &=
\int \pi (\theta) p(\theta^{\prime}|\theta) d\theta^{\prime} \\
&= \pi (\theta) \int p(\theta|\theta^{\prime}) d\theta^{\prime} \\
&= \pi (\theta)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_stationary}
\end{equation}

\noindent which reveals $\pi (\cdot)$ is a
\textit{stationary distribution}.  \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_stationary} is a special case of
\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_marginal} in that $\pi( \cdot )$ is invariant across all iterations (for this reason
it is also referred to as an \textit{invariant distribution}).  When $p(\theta^{\prime}|\theta)$ is irreducible and
aperiodic it will have a single stationary distribution and is \textit{ergodic}, or guaranteed to converge as
$t \rightarrow \infty$ regardless of initial distribution.

\vspace{-15pt}

\begin{equation}
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} f^{(t)}(\theta) \rightarrow \pi (\theta)\ \ \forall f^{(0)}
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_converge}
\end{equation}

A frequent objective in developing MCMC algorithms is to create Markov Chains that are reversible, ergodic, homogeneous
(no variation in $p(\vect{\theta}^{\prime}|\vect{\theta})$ in $t$), and has its target distribution as its stationary distribution.

$\vect{\theta}$ may contain parameters that are necessary for the model but of little interest,
known as \textit{nuisance parameters}, $\vect{\theta}^{(N)}$ ($\vect{\theta} = [\vect{\theta}^{(I)}, \vect{\theta}^{(N)}]$ with
$\vect{\theta}^{(I)}$ representing parameters of interest).  It can often be the case that we wish to \textit{marginalize}, or integrate
over $\vect{\theta}^{(N)}$
\begin{equation}
p(\vect{\theta}^{(I)}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha}) = \int_{\Theta^{(N)}}
p(\vect{\theta}^{(I)}, \vect{\theta}^{(N)}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha}) \vectlett{d}^{n^{(N)}}\vect{\theta}^{(N)}
\end{equation}

\noindent though this in general may be difficult to compute.  However, sampling from the MCMC posterior joint distribution
$p(\vect{\theta}^{(I)}, \vect{\theta}^{(N)}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha})$ naturally provides values for $\vect{\theta}^{(I)}$ from the
marginalized posterior $p(\vect{\theta}^{(I)}|\vectlett{x}, \vect{\alpha})$.  This technique can be done in general for any number of
parameters in $\vect{\theta}$.  Often it is interesting to know the posterior of a single parameter, in which case all others would
be marginalized over.  This is an advantage over many other techniques.

MCMCs have become increasingly popular in recent years as advances in methods and computer processing speeds have made them
a powerful tool that can be run in reasonable timescales.  For this analysis an implementation by \citeref{Foreman2013} of
the Affine-Invariant Ensemble Sampler proposed by \citeref{Goodman2010} modified to allow stretch move update step parallelization is
used as outlined below.  A Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DEMC) is used in \secref{subsec:elifetime_fit_mcmc} for the electron
lifetime analysis.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize $k$ walkers of $n$-dimensional parameter space to some state $\vect{\theta}(t = 0)$ (for this analysis samples are
randomly drawn from $p(\vect{\theta}|\vect{\alpha})$).

\item \label{itm:divide} Divide the ensemble into subsets $S^{(0)} = \{\vect{\theta}_i, \forall i = 1, . . ., k/2\}$, and
$S^{(1)} = \{\vect{\theta}_i, \forall i = k/2 + 1, . . ., k\}$.

\item \label{itm:newstate} For each walker in $S^{(0)}$ randomly select a walker $\vect{\theta}_j^{(1)}$ from $S^{(1)}$ and propose a new
state
\begin{equation}
\vect{\theta}_p = \vect{\theta}_j^{(1)} + z \big[ \vect{\theta}_i(t) - \vect{\theta}_j^{(1)} \big]
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_walker_update}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $z$ is randomly drawn from distribution $g(z)$. This affine-invariant stretch move is shown in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_update}.  Choosing
$g(z^{-1}) = z g(z)$ keeps \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_walker_update} symmetric - that is, the proposal
distributions for $\vect{\theta}_i \rightarrow \vect{\theta}_p$ and $\vect{\theta}_p \rightarrow \vect{\theta}_i$ are
equivalent.  Choosing the
acceptance probability of the proposed stretch move update step as
\begin{equation}
q = \mathrm{min} \bigg( 1, z^{n - 1} \frac{\mathcal{L}(\vect{\theta}_p)p(\vect{\theta}_p|\vect{\alpha}_p)}
{\mathcal{L}(\vect{\theta}_i)p(\vect{\theta}_i|\vect{\alpha}_i)} \bigg)
\label{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_prob}
\end{equation}

\noindent ensuring the chain will satisfy detailed balance.  \citeref{Foreman2013} uses
\begin{equation}
g(z) \propto
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{z}} & \mathrm{if}\ z \in \bigg[ \dfrac{1}{a}, a \bigg], \\
0 & \mathrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent with $a$ as a scalable parameter as recommended by \citeref{Goodman2010}.

\item \label{itm:rand} Generate a random number from a uniform distribution $r \in [0, 1]$.  If $r \leq q$ then accept proposed state
$\vect{\theta}_i(t + 1/2) = \vect{\theta}_p$, otherwise keep present state $\vect{\theta}_i(t + 1/2) = \vect{\theta}_i(t)$.

\item \label{itm:update}  Set $t = t + 1/2$.

\item \label{itm:rerun_second_half} Repeat steps \cref{itm:newstate,itm:rand,itm:update} for $S^{(1)}$ using the updated $S^{(0)}$.

\item Repeat \cref{itm:newstate,itm:rand,itm:update,itm:rerun_second_half} for $T$ iterations.
\end{enumerate}

The advantage of the above implementation is the computationally expensive stretch move update steps
(\cref{itm:newstate,itm:rand,itm:update}) are run
for each walker in parallel, saving enormous amounts of time with sufficient computing power.  Running all $k$ walkers in parallel would
break detailed balance, but splitting into two groups satisfies it.

Because the Affine-Invariant Ensemble Sampler satisfies \eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mcmc_converge} it is guaranteed
to converge as $t \rightarrow \infty$.  However, having a finite number of samples allows us to test for convergence,
though it can never be proved.  An important metric for evaluating the results is the acceptance fraction
$\mathcal{F}$.  This is the fraction of proposed stretch move update steps that are accepted by a walker (step \cref{itm:rand}).  There is
no consensus on an optimal value.  $\mathcal{F} \sim 0$ would mean nearly all steps are rejected so there would be few independent samples
and the target density would be poorly explored.  $\mathcal{F} \sim 1$ means nearly every proposal is accepted in which case
the chain is in a random walk with little regard for the posterior.  A reasonable range is considered to be $0.2 \mdash 0.5$.

Thus $\mathcal{F}$ is
the fraction of proposals that are accepted over the course of the fit.  Even if the posterior of $\vect{\theta}_p$ is less than
that of $\vect{\theta}_i$ the proposal may be accepted.  We do not need to know the marginal
likelihood (\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match_p_data}) to perform an Affine-Invariant Ensemble Sampler MCMC
fit.

A metric to assess convergence is the autocorrelation time, which measures the number
of evaluations to produce independent samples of the target density and is recommended by \citeref{Foreman2013}.  The Affine-Invariant
Ensemble Sampler has been shown to have a smaller autocorrelation time than the popular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
\citeref{Goodman2010}.  The autocorrelation time is affine-invariant, which makes it a reasonable measurement to quantify
the convergence of samplers with varying levels of density anisotropy.

A second metric and the main one used in
this analysis is the Gelman-Rubin statistic $\hat{R}$ \citeref{Gelman1992}.  It compares the average variance of the individual chains
with the variance between chains, with the idea being the two should be nearly equivalent when the fit has converged.

For this analysis the electronic and nuclear recoil bands are fit with  $n = 44\ \mathrm{parameters}$ and an Affine-Invariant Ensemble
Sampler with $k = 200$ walkers over 11,000 steps.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:er_nr_calibrations_results}
With the model and statistical inference outlined in \secref{sec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ} the results are now
presented.  A ``burin-in'' period exists in the beginning of the MCMC as walkers move from their initialized values to fill the parameter
space that should be ignored in the posterior.  For this analysis the burn-in lasted ${\sim}1000\ \mathrm{iterations}$.  The posterior of
the MCMC fit is defined as the final $1000\ \mathrm{iterations}$ for the 200 walkers.  Marginalized posteriors in
\tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_results_er,tab:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match,tab:er_nr_calibrations_results_backgrounds} are
calculated using these 200,000 samples.  Medians and credible regions shown in
figures are computed using 400 samples randomly drawn from the posterior.  The Gelman-Rubin statistic in this region is
shown in \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_gr} and is ${\sim}2$.  Ideally it would be closer to 1 but time restrictions did not allow
continued fitting.  Regardless, $\hat{R} \sim 2$ indicates the fit is likely close to the best-fit PDF, though as mentioned above
convergence can never be proven for a finite number of steps.

\subsection{Detector Physics Model and Backgrounds}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_results_par_post}
Once the microphysics of the interaction has occurred (results in \secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_results_ly_qy}), the
photons and \electron are influenced by detector effects
(\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys}).  In addition, an S2 threshold requirement, S1 peak finding efficiency, and
S1 and S2 selection efficiencies remove some events (results in \secref{subsec:dark_matter_results_selection}).  Parameters are shared
within and across science runs and listed in \tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match}.

$\mathrm{cS2_b}$, but limited statistics make it difficult to tell.}

Accidental coincidence and electronic recoil backgrounds during calibrations (surface events are absent or negligible at

distributions and expectations are computed separately for each source and tightly constrained by the method in
\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_additional_components}.  SR0 and SR1 \ce{^{220}Rn} calibrations are constrained by a
single parameter since they are expected to be correlated as
$R_{\mathrm{AC}}^{\mathrm{(SR1)}} = 3.75 R_{\mathrm{AC}}^{\mathrm{(SR0)}} - 0.0625$.  ER backgrounds - only relevant for
\ambe and NG
(for \ce{^{220}Rn} it simply contributes to the ER band) - is required to be $\geq 0$ but otherwise is unconstrained.  The initial values,

Some portion of events in the \ambe and NG data are from neutrons that scatter more than once in the TPC.  As mentioned in
\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_cuts}, a single scatter selection is applied to remove multiple-scatter
events.  However,
it can be difficult in some cases to determine if in fact additional scatters occurred - particularly at low energy.  The fast MC framework
applies the same selection used on the data to replicate this effect as closely as possible.  Extracting the spectra of single and
multiple scatters separately provides a powerful tool to examine this.  The \ambe
(\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr0_cs1,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr1_cs1,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr0_cs2,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr1_cs2,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr0_cs1_log_cs2_cs1,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ambe_sr1_cs1_log_cs2_cs1})
and NG
(\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ng_sr1_cs1,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ng_sr1_cs2,fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ng_sr1_cs1_log_cs2_cs1})
figures show the single-
and multiple-scatter contributions in cS1, $\mathrm{cS2_b}$, and cS1-$\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b/cS1})$.

The fraction of \ambe data that comes from single scatters is $f_{\mathrm{^{241}AmBe, ss}} = 0.6742_{-0.0081}^{+0.0096}$
(fraction of multiple scatters is $f_{\mathrm{^{241}AmBe, ms}} = 0.3258_{-0.0096}^{+0.0081}$).  For NG data it is
$f_{\mathrm{NG, ss}} = 0.6483_{-0.0079}^{+0.0092}$ ($f_{\mathrm{NG, ms}} = 0.3517_{-0.0092}^{+0.0079}$).  Despite the single scatter
selection
roughly one third of events in the final data come from multiple scatters.  This is because the vast majority of events occur at low energy,
which is where the selection is least effective.  Because multiple-scatter neutrons are considered in the fast MC this should not have a
large bias on our final result.

The fraction of nuclear recoil events that scatter more than once and pass the multiple scatter (and other) selection for the SR1 \ambe
calibration is shown in
\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ms_fraction}.  Because S1s cannot be resolved, events with multiple scatters will have an
inflated S1.  The resulting decrease in $\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1})$ will become more dramatic for events with a
larger number of scatters.  In addition, the LCE map correction
(\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_det_phys_cs1}) uses the position of the highest-energy event.  This
increases the spread in the cS1 distribution since additional scatters in lower or higher LCE region will be under- or over-corrected,
respectively.  As the highest-energy event increases, the relative effect becomes smaller since the multiple scatter cut prevents large
secondary \stwob and therefore large S1s.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ms_fraction}
\caption{Fraction of nuclear recoil events in SR1 \ambe calibration that result from multiple scatters.  In the main panel red and
blue lines mark the median and $\pm 2\sigma$ for single and multiple scatters, respectively (at $\mathrm{cS1} > 60\ \mathrm{PE}$ the
number of multiple scatter events is too low for calculation).  Multiple scatters will be pushed to smaller
$\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1})$.  The effect becomes more dramatic at lower
$\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1})$ due to a couple effects.  The first is a larger number of scatters will lead to a
smaller $\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1}$.  Additionally the S1s are corrected by the LCE map
according the position of the largest scatter, so S1s in a higher-LCE region
would be over-corrected.  This also leads to the magnitude of the dip between SS and MS percentiles extending to higher $\mathrm{cS1}$
at lower $\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1})$.  At sufficiently high $\mathrm{cS1}$ (${\gtrsim}\, 40\ \mathrm{PE}$) the
\cstwob must be large enough that S1s from other scatters do not have much effect, since a secondary scatter with a large S1 should also
contain a large \stwob and fail the multiple scatter cut.  The top and right panels are integrated over the main panel and show the
multiple scatter fraction with respect to $\mathrm{cS1}$ (top) and $\mathrm{log}_{10}(\mathrm{cS2_b / cS1})$ (right).}

\subsection{Acceptances}
\label{subsec:dark_matter_results_selection}
The acceptances are calculated using 400 randomly-drawn samples from the posterior
and an expected WIMP spectrum.  While the 1.3 t fiducial mass is used for the dark matter analysis, the
acceptances are calculated using the 1 t mass from the band fit, though they are not expected to differ significantly.  The posterior
for the S1 peak-finding efficiency and S1 and S2 cut efficiencies are listed in
\tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_mc_match}.  They, along with the S2 and cS1 thresholds, are
shown in \figref{fig:dark_matter_results_selection_acc_components} for SR0 and SR1.  The S1 and S2 cut
efficiencies (\secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_cuts}) are shown in pink and light blue, and show little variation
across energy.  The S2 threshold
is only relevant at low energies (${\lesssim}\, 5\ \mathrm{keV_{nr}}$) and is highlighted in green.  The processor efficiency is marked in
red.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{acceptances_bbf_inputs}
\caption{Nuclear recoil energy-dependent efficiencies calculated using 400 samples randomly drawn from the posterior of the band fit.  Best-fit
values are shown for S1 (pink) and S2 (light blue) selection, S2 threshold (green), processor (red), and cS1 threshold (dark blue)
efficiencies.  Dashed lines represent medians from SR0 while solid lines and shaded regions show SR1 medians and 68\% credible regions.}

\begin{figure}

respectively.  The shaded regions are the 68\% credible interval for SR1.  Spectra are shown for 10 (dashed), 50 (dotted), and
200 (dash-dotted) $\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ WIMPs in purple.}

\end{figure}

The cS1 threshold $3 \leq \mathrm{cS1} \leq 70\ \mathrm{PE}$ (blue in
\figref{fig:dark_matter_results_selection_acc_components}) marks the energy region of interest, corresponding to roughly
$[1.4, 10.6]\ \mathrm{keV_{ee}}$ and $[4.9, 40.9]\ \mathrm{keV_{nr}}$.  The total acceptance is the product of the acceptances shown
in \figref{fig:dark_matter_results_selection_acc_components}.  Effects from events that are gained or lost at the edge of the fiducial
volume are expected to be small so are not considered.

\figref{fig:dark_matter_results_acceptances_band_fitting} (redrawn from \secref{subsec:dark_matter_results_selection})
shows the efficiencies for 1) S1 peak finding (``Detection''), 2) S1 peak finding and S1
and S2 selections (``Selection''), 3) total, excluding the reference region (``Energy region''), and 4) total, including the reference
region (``Reference'').

The acceptances are used in the likelihood calculation in \secref{subsec:dark_matter_results_background}.



\subsection{Light and Charge Yields}
\label{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_results_ly_qy}
In \secref{subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er,subsec:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr} the number
of photons and electrons produced were calculated for electronic and nuclear recoils using models that describe
the microphysics of xenon interactions.  Because dark matter searches rely on energy reconstruction, having dependable models is
crucial.  Values are quoted as light (or photon) yield, $L_y$, and charge (or electron) yield $Q_y$ and are defined as
$n_{\mathrm{ph}}/E$ and $n_{\mathrm{e}} / E$, respectively.

The microphysics model for electronic recoils depends on the mean energy
per quanta $W$, Fano Factor $F$, and exciton-to-ion ratio $n_{\mathrm{ex}} / n_{\mathrm{ion}}$.  Recombination is computed using
a modified Thomas-Imel box model (\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_ti}) and recombination fluctuations
(\eqnref{eq:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_er_rec_fluctuations}).  The priors and marginalized posteriors are shown in
\tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_results_er}.

\figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ly_qy_er} shows the light and
charge yields for electronic recoils for this result along with values from previous experiments.  Because the ER model parameters were
not constrained (aside from physical restrictions) our result is an independent measurement of $L_y$ and $Q_y$.  Our
$82\ \mathrm{V\ cm^{-1}}$ seems to be higher (lower) in $L_y$ ($Q_y$) at $E \gtrsim 2\ \mathrm{keV}$ than
other measurements, while the $200\ \mathrm{V\ cm^{-1}}$ agrees well with all but the PIXeY \ce{^{37}Ar}.  However, we should be careful
when comparing measurements since different electric fields change the $L_y/Q_y$ ratio.

The microphysics for nuclear recoils is described by $\alpha$, $\zeta$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $k$, $\eta$, and $\lambda$.  It shares
only one
parameter, $W$, with the electronic recoil model.  The exciton-to-ion ratio is parameterized differently than for electronic recoils.  To
date, recombination fluctuations (RFs) have not been observed for nuclear recoils so they are omitted from the model.  The priors and
marginalized posteriors are shown in \tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_results_er}.  Because
asymmetric gaussian distributions are not used, the uncertainties differ slightly from the NEST results
(\tabref{tab:er_nr_calibrations_parameter_determ_nr_nest}), with generally the larger of the two selected
\citeref{NEST2015}.

Historically nuclear recoil light yield measurements have been quoted as
$\mathcal{L}_{eff}$, the ratio of scintillation yields of nuclear recoils to that of the \ce{^{57}Co} 122 keV \gammaray at zero
electric field.  This was done in part to account for detector effects so long as a second measurement with \ce{^{57}Co} was
performed.  122 keV photons have an attenuation length of just 3 mm so can probe only the very
outermost region of tonne-scale TPCs.  Therefore the absolute light yield $L_y = \mathcal{L}_{eff} \times 63\ \mathrm{ph\ keV^{-1}}$ has
become the standard notation.  \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ly_qy_nr} shows the light and charge yields for nuclear
recoils.  Unlike the electronic recoil result, this is not an independent measurement of $L_y$ and $Q_y$ since the emission model
parameters are constrained by \citeref{NEST2015}.  The
$L_y$ agrees well at ${\gtrsim}\, 3\ \mathrm{keV}$ but there is larger disagreement in $Q_y$.  Strangely, it diverges significantly at
$E > 40\ \mathrm{keV}$ where our acceptance is high (${\sim} 80\%$).  As with \figref{fig:er_nr_calibrations_results_ly_qy_er} we should
exercise caution when comparing yields at different fields, though the effect for nuclear recoils is known to be less stark.
