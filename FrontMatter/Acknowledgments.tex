First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Elena Aprile, who welcomed me into her research group in 2014.  I owe this dissertation and my
remarkable research experience over the past four years to your guidance and encouragement.  You exemplify scientific excellence and
innovation, and are a role model for young academics.

I would like to give a special thanks to Qing Lin, Patrick de Perio, and Fei Gao.  You committed your time and energy to helping me grow
as a graduate student.  So much of what I have learned over the years is thanks to you.  I feel fortunate to have had you as mentors.

I would also like to thank postdoctoral fellows and research scientists Guillaume Plante, Marc Weber, Luke Goetzke, Marcello Messina, and
Alfio Rizzo.  Your patience and encouragement over the years, especially at the beginning, shaped my four years in the group.

I have had a lot of fun working alongside graduate students Matt Anthony, Yun Zhang, Joey Howlett, and Tianyu Zhu.  The experiments,
analyses, and trips I've shared with you were among the most memorable of my time at Columbia.  I am also happy to have had the
opportunity to get to know Damon Daw, who worked in our group for a couple of years.

I am grateful to Marcela Stern.  You are one of the kindest and most diligent people I know.  You made my life easier on so many
occasions.  It has been such a pleasure knowing you.

I feel extremely fortunate to have gotten to know Jeremy Dodd these last six years.  You are both
a mentor and friend, and were there for me in times of uncertainty.  You had a remarkable impact on my time
at Columbia, and I am forever grateful.

I am especially thankful to my friends and fellow PhD students Felix Clark, Matt Anthony, Laura Havener, Ryne Carbone, Geoff Iwata, and
Russell Smith.  I feel privileged to have made such long-lasting friends during this experience.  Your support during difficult times,
both personally and professionally,
has been indispensable.  I especially want to thank Felix Clark, who was my roommate, along with Rex Brown.

I am eternally grateful to my family, who has supported and believed in me my entire life.  My parents, Pam and Brock, give me the
confidence
and love that motivates me.  My brother, Spencer, is the bravest and most inspiring person I know.  I also want to thank my aunt, Diana,
uncle, Mark, and cousins, Marissa and Tyler for their encouragement.  I consider myself very lucky to have such strong relationships with
you.

My family has been through some difficult times.  Your love and support gave me the courage and confidence to face these
challenges.  You continue to teach me the importance of kindness, hard work,
and joie de vivre, and most important of all, family.  You have made me who I am.  I love you.
